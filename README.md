STM32F411RE Bare Metal Drivers
This repository contains my custom bare-metal peripheral drivers for the STM32F411RE microcontroller, developed without using the HAL or LL libraries.

Implemented Drivers:
GPIO Driver

USART Driver

I2C Driver

SPI Driver

The drivers are written from scratch following the STM32F4 Reference Manual and Datasheet.
